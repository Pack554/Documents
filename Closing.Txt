I hope, and feel you had a great time and wish you leave this ceremony with joyful memories, and excitement for the next time we can gather.
For closing, campfire program tradition is to leave with a song of reverence, like a hymn.
Tonight, we will sign Cub Scout Vespers. It's to the tune of tannenbaum or Oh Christmas Tree. 
We'll sing it twice, join in as you can.
Without further ado, our next, and final spot, is Cub Scout Vespers.
