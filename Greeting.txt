Thank for Ben for a lovely opening.
Welcome all.
What a year? right? There was a minute or two I was worried.
So I'm touched to see you all out here, in force. Thank you cub. Parents. Leaders. for pushing through to get here. You deserve a round of applause.
Who all been to a campfire program? Raise your hand.
I thought I had, but went I went to Wood Badge, I learned it's more that stories and smores. Sorry cubs.
It's a sacred ceremony where we gather in fellowship. My hopes is you do so with an open heart.
Pout in to thes skits and songs and have some fun.
I, as MC, will be announcing the order of events. You might have with you a program outlining them.
When a spot comes on, meaning song, skit, or event, I'll announce it to you. You'll repeat the title, then yall, "My Favorite!"
Got it? Ready?
Next up, i sthe Bears, performing the skit, Echo!
*wait*
Ben, you are on deck.
