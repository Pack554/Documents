# Flag Ceremony Color Guard Calls

The Scout calling the flag ceremony reads the big text. 

## Flag presentation

Start out with the color guard in the rear. The color guard are the Scouts who hold the flag(s) and the other Scouts who accompany the Scouts who hold flags. You’ll have one or two command callers in the front, who read these commands:

**1\. WILL THE AUDIENCE PLEASE RISE**

**2\. COLOR GUARD, ATTENTION**

This command tells the color guards to assure they are paying attention.

**3\. COLOR GUARD, ADVANCE**

This command tells the color guards to begin walking towards where the flags are to be posted.

**4\. COLOR GUARD, HALT. POST THE COLORS.**

**5\. SCOUT SALUTE**

**6\. PLEASE JOIN ME IN THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE**

**7\. I PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE TO THE FLAG OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, AND TO THE REPUBLIC FOR WHICH IT STANDS, ONE NATION UNDER GOD, INDIVISIBLE, WITH LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL**

**8\. TWO**

This command tells Scouts to drop their salute.

**9\. COLOR GUARD, RETURN TO POST**

This command tells the color guards to return to where they started, often at the back of the room.

**10\. COLOR GUARD, DISMISSED**

This command disbands the color guard.

**11\. THE AUDIENCE MAY BE SEATED**

## Flag retirement

Start out with the color guard in the rear. The color guard are the Scouts who hold the flag(s) and the other Scouts who accompany the Scouts who hold flags. You’ll have one or two command callers in the front, who read these commands:

Before going to next step, wait for the audience to stand and be attentive. You may need to repeat the command or clarify to the audience if they aren’t standing or attentive.

**2\. COLOR GUARD, ATTENTION**

This reminds the color guard to be ready for the next command.

**3\. COLOR GUARD, ADVANCE**

Wait for the color guard to arrive to the front. Say the next command right as they arrive to the point where they will put the flags.

**4\. COLOR GUARD, RETRIEVE THE COLORS**

Wait for the color guard to have the flags in hand before the next step.

**5\. SCOUT SALUTE**

This command is said right when the color guard starts to walk away with the flags.
